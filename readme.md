A code ninjas journey to learning how to put it all together and making a functional app. Learning from several references, sites, and pages, I learned that the method being used for my work has to be consistent. Needed to find what worked for my mindset and stick to it, because the numerous approaches may not match with eachother! The following are notes on Code Quiz:

* [Quiz App](https://malhill.github.io/Code-Quiz/ "Quiz App")

### HTML
Simple and effective. 
* Create Id's and get them ready for Javascript.
* Created two HTML's for the questions and the highscores. 
* Set the links to each other 
* Made sure text and buttons are in place
* All links and scripts to CSS and JS are checked

### Javascript 
A ton of console.log's and stress naps
* Double checked the connecion to html page
* Referenced codeacademy, Js hero, hackerrank, github, w3schools, etc. 
* Step by step and console logging with comments to make sure I understand the purpose of the functions (staying focused)
* A lot more of the plug and play

### CSS 
Saving the dressing for last. 
* Initially seperating the Quiz and Highscores coding for organization
* Refactoring the CSS for easy reading

### ReadMe
Github woul give me 404 errors and its because I added a 'a' code link by accident in the HTML. Hopefully this corrects the error.
